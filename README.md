# BuddyHub for Oqtane

**The open-source community engine built for .NET developers.**  
BuddyHub is a modular plugin for the [Oqtane Framework](https://www.oqtane.org/) that brings social networking, collaboration, and marketplace capabilities to .NET-powered portals.  
It is designed to kickstart SaaS-style communities with integrated stores, profiles, groups, and more â€” all running on open source and low-code logic.

## ðŸ”¥ Vision

**"Community-first by design. Code-first by power."**  
BuddyHub is built to empower developers, labs, coaches, freelancers, and small organizations to launch their own interactive portals.  
Think of it as the .NET answer to BuddyBoss, but faster, modular, and license-free.
